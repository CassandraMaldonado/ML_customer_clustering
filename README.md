## Why this project exists (business framing)

Most marketing programs treat customers as one audience. In reality, customers behave differently:
- some are high-value repeat buyers,
- others only respond to discounts,
- some browse a lot but rarely purchase,
- some are new and need onboarding nudges.

**Customer clustering** turns a large customer base into a small set of actionable segments so teams can:
- tailor messaging and offers,
- allocate budget more efficiently,
- track ROI by segment instead of guessing.
